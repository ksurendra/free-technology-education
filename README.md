# Curated List of Technology Education Offered For Free 
I am a big fan of open-source software and open learning. There are so many passionate designers/developers around the globe who produce a lot of content to train, teach, coach their community on what they learned, how they learned and their experiences. The trends are that software companies are encouraging this and usually make these **invaluable** resources for the developer community for FREE. 

I'm also a big fan of **continuous learning** and rely on these course, material, talks so much and wanted to make a list of all technology related courses available for **FREE** by top technology companies.

Below is a list of such:
* [List of Free Technology Education from Software Development or Consuming Companies](https://github.com/ksurendra/free-technology-education/blob/master/free_technology_education_list.md)

## Disclaimer
I tried to only make a list of courses, resources from the software companies themeselves and not from other sources. Although they are better and offer more diverse content, i wanted to restrict this list to offerings from companies only and not indivualus. If we start listing all of it, i'm sure that will crosee millions :-)

## Contribution
Please create an issue to submit a new course, education material you found that is helpful to developer community. Also we welcome thoughts, feedbcak and any bugs.
